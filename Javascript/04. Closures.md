# Closures
A closure is the combination of function bundled together with reference to it's surrounding state, meaning access to it's outer scope's variables.

```js
function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms a closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```
