# Promises
Promises are the objects that represents some value in the future with either resolve or reject. Basically used for implementing asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
### States of Promises
- Pending
- Fullfilled
- Rejected

## Creating a Promise
Promise can be created using the Promise Construtor, which takes an "executor" funtion as an argument. This executor function takes 2 argument: <b>resolve</b> and <b>reject</b> which are functions provided by javascript to signal the outcome of asynchronous operations.
```js
let myPromise = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(resp => resolve(resp))
    .catch((err) => reject(err));
})
```

## Consuming a Promise
To handle the outcome of a Promise, we use .then() and .catch() methods.

    myPromise
    .then((message) => {
        console.log(message); // "Operation successful!"
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error); // "Operation failed!"
    });

### .then(onFullfilled, onRejected)
This method will execute if the promise is fullfilled.
### .catch(onRejected)
This method will get executed if the promise gets rejected.


## Promise Chaining
Promise can be chain together, allowing us to perform asynchronous tasks in sequential manner.
```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
        return data.id; // Pass a value to the next .then
    })
    .then(id => {
        console.log("Processed ID:", id);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    });
```
