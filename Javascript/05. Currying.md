# Currying
Funtional programming techniques used to execute multiple funtions in a sequential manner only if the condition met(must have arguments to pass).

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(add(2, 3));

// now what if a or b is null 
// to solve this problem we can use currying, when all the values are there then only funtion will execute properly 

const curriedAdd = (a) => {
  return (b) => {
    return a + b;
  };
};

console.log(curriedAdd(2)(3));
```
