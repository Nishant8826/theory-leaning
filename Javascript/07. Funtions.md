# Functions
- Block of reusable code that can be called to perform a specific task.
- Accepts data through parameter and return a value.


## Function Declaration
Standard and most common way to decalare a function. Also called regular function.
- `Hoisting` : takes place in regular function.
- `this` binding : depends on how the function is called.
- `Readability` : often considered more readable
```js
greet('Nishant')

function greet(name){
    return `Hello ${name}`
}
```

## Function Expression
function is assigned to a variable. Also called anonymous function.
- `Hoisting` : not hoisted, can't access before initialization.
- `this` binding : depends on how the function is called.
```js
const greet = function(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

greet("Nishant");
```

## Arrow function
Introduced in ES6, a shoter syntax for declaring function.
- `Hoisting` : not hoisted, can't access before initialization.
- `this` binding : don't have their own this, instead they inherit from the surrounding parent scope at the time of creation.
```js
// Concise single-line arrow function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5

// Arrow function with a block body
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b;
};
console.log(multiply(4, 5)); // Output: 20
```
