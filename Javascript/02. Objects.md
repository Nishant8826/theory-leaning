# Object
## In JavaScript eventhing is an object (non-primitive data type)
- Collection of properties and method or Key and Value pair
```bash
Before ES6 Funtion Contructor was there to build a blue print of an object and after ES6 Classes were introduced
```
# Protototype
In JS, a prototype is an object which is being inherit from other object by name [[Prototype]].

### Prototypal Inheritance
Every object in JavaScript has an internal link to another object called prototype (can be destructure by Object.__ proto__ ). When we try to fetch any key in an object, first JavaScript look inside the object itself, if not found then start looking inside the object's prototype and then its prototype's prototype and so on, forming a prototype chain until the chain will end(object's prototype becomes null).

### Shadowing
If an object itself has the property and prototype also have the same, then JavaScript will shadow the inherited property and use object's property, this is called <b>shadowing</b>

## Inheritance
Passing down the properties and method from parent class to child class.

#### Achieving Inheritance
- Using <b>extends</b> keyword : Most common and modern way to achieving inheritance.
- Using <b>Object.create()</b>


## Super
- Used in derived class to invoked the constructor of parent class.
- Accessing the parent class properties and methods in derived class.
