# How NodeJs Work?
### 1. When a request will made from client, it will get placed in event queue.
### 2. Event loop will continously monitor the event queue, if event are there, then event loop will start processing them in FIFO order.
### 3. If event is non-blocking, then event loop will process it and send back the response to the client.
### 4. If event is blocking, then event loop will assign a thread to it from threadpool(libuv) and proceed further to execute next event
### 5. When worker task is completed then worker will register a "completion" event inside an appropriate callback queue.
### 6. When event loop will free, picks up the "completion" event from the queue and execute it, finally sends the response to the client.
