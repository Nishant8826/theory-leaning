# ORM and ODM
An ORM(Object Relational Mapper) and an ODM(Object Document Mapper) are both tools that can help developers to interact with databases using an Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) language.
- ORM is for <b>Relational</b> databeses like SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- ODM is from <b>Document</b> based databeses like MongoDB.

### They both act as a translator between application code and database.
