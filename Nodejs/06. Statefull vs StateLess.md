# Stateful
- System that keeps the data of interaction between client and server.
- How it works? Stores the session data on the server, which will then used to fullfill the request.
- Pros : More secured way for a short period of time.
- Cons : If server goes down, then these session data will also get wipes out, harder to scale

# Stateless
- System that doesn't keep session data on the server, instead it will take it from the shared storage between client and server.
- all requests are independently treated.
- more scalable and efficient.
