# Streams
Best Technique to handle data in small, manageable chunks rather than all at once. More efficient in terms of machine memory and performance when dealing with large files.

## NodeJs has 4 stream type:
### Readable Stream
when we need to to just read the data

### Writeable Stream
When we need to write inside the file using stream.

### Duplex Stream
When we need to do both read and write.

### Transform Stream
