# Indexes
- Indexes are used to keep the track of stored documents
- Very efficient in case of fetch queries because MongoDB already knew where the document has been kept(so directly jumped on that document withoud scanning whole collection).
- Like in books index page, which chapter is on what page number is already mentioned in index page.
- Be default _id is already indexed in MongoDB, that's why findById is more efficient than findOne method.
- stored in B-Tree(Binary Tree) structure to keep the values of indexed fields in a sorted manner.

## Advantages
- Speed up on the read operations.

## Disadvantage
- Impact on write operations : Insertion, updates and deletion will get slow becuase the indexes needs to be maintained.

## Common Index Type
### 1. `Single-field indexes` improves query performance on one field

```js
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 });
```

### 2. `Compound indexes` on miltiple fields.

### 3. `Unique indexes` no repetetive value for an indexed field.

### 4. `Multikey indexes` on all elements of an array of document(like tags of books collection).
```js
db.books.createIndex({ tags: 1 });
```
### etc.
