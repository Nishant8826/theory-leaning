# What is Database?
Database is a place where we store the **collection of data** in **organizedd** form.

# SQL vs NoSQL
## 1. Scalability
- **SQLd** is vertically scalable meaning we can add more resources to a single server for scaling, which has again limits e.g. previous database have 100TB of store if we want to scale it up then we need to add more resource to the server replacing 100TB to 200TB, hence costly.
- **NoSQLd** designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers, hence less costly than SQL.   

## SQL(Relational) vs NoSQL (Non-relational) Comparison

| **Feature** | **SQL (Relational)** | **NoSQL (Non-relational)** |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Data Model** | Data stored in **tables (rows & columns)** with fixed relationships via foreign keys. Great for structured data. | Stores data in flexible formats ‚Äî **documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs** ‚Äî perfect for unstructured or semi-structured data. |
| **Schema** | **Fixed schema** ‚Äî you must define the structure before inserting data. Changing it later is painful. | **Dynamic or schema-less** ‚Äî add new fields anytime without breaking existing data. Super handy for fast-evolving apps. |
| **Scalability** | **Vertical scaling** (add more power to one server). Horizontal scaling is possible but complex. | **Horizontal scaling** (add more servers easily). Ideal for apps handling huge traffic or big data. |
| **Transactions** | **ACID compliant** ‚Äî ensures reliable transactions (perfect for banking, inventory, etc.). | Follows **BASE** (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent). Focuses on speed and availability. Some like MongoDB now support ACID too. |
| **Querying** | Uses **SQL** ‚Äî powerful, standardized queries with joins and aggregations. | Query syntax varies by database (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-style queries). Great for simple lookups, less ideal for complex joins. |
| **Best For** | Use when you need **structured data, consistency, and complex queries** ‚Äî e.g., accounting, ERP, e-commerce. | Use when you need **speed, flexibility, and scalability** ‚Äî e.g., social apps, real-time analytics, content-heavy systems. |
| **Examples** | üêò PostgreSQL, üíæ MySQL | üçÉ MongoDB, ‚ö° Redis |

### Quick Summary

- **SQL** ‚Üí Structured data, strong consistency, powerful queries, but rigid and harder to scale.  
- **NoSQL** ‚Üí Flexible data, high performance, easy to scale, but less standardized queries.

### How to choose between SQL and NoSQL?
- **Scalability** : If your project needs to scale vertically i.e. adding more resource to the single server, then SQL is good and If you project can grow in future and you want to add more servers than NoSQL is a better fit.

- **Data Structure** : If data is strutured then SQL, If data is unstructure then NoSQL.

- **Data Integrity** : If your data is consistent and transaction is must then SQL, If you want highly scalable, better performance then NoSQL.
