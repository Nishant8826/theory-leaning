# Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Feature | **Monolithic Architecture** | **Microservices Architecture** |
|--------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Single, tightly-coupled application where UI, business logic, and data access layers are combined into one unit. | Application is divided into multiple small, autonomous services, each handling a specific business capability. |
| **Scalability** | Difficult to scale any module independently; must scale the entire system | Easily scalable as each service can be scaled independently. |
| **Development** | Easier to develop intially but becomes complex as it grows. | More complex from the start but easier to manage for large applications. |
| **Deployment** | Redeploy the entire application for small updates | Independent deployment for each service; supports CI/CD. |
| **Performance** | High performance due to in-process calls. | Slightly lower due to network communication overhead. |
| **Technology Stack** | Single technology stack (technology lock-in). | Each service can use its own language, framework, and database. |
| **Testing & Debugging** | Easier — single codebase and centralized logs. | Harder — distributed logs require tracing/monitoring tools. |
| **Complexity** | Low — easier to build and maintain initially. | High — requires DevOps, orchestration, monitoring, service discovery. |
| **Data Management** | Simple — usually single database with strong consistency. | Complex — multiple databases require eventual consistency strategies. |
| **Best For** | Small teams, simple applications, MVPs, limited infra. | Large systems, need high scalability, multiple independent teams. |
| **Examples** | Early Netflix, Early Amazon, small startups. | Modern Netflix, Uber, Amazon, Twitter. |

## 📌 When to Choose What?

### 🏗️ **Choose Monolithic If:**
- You have a **small team**
- Application is **simple**
- Need to build and launch **quickly**
- Have a **limited budget**
- Early stage startup or MVP

### 🧩 **Choose Microservices If:**
- You have a **large/complex system**
- Need **independent scalability**
- Want **fault isolation**
- Multiple teams working in parallel
- High deployment frequency (CI/CD)
