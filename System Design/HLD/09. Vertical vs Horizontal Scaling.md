Vertical scaling increases a single machine's capacity (CPU, RAM), while horizontal scaling adds more machines to distribute the load

| Feature        | Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down) | Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In) |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **How it works** | Increases the resources (CPU, RAM, storage) of a single server. | Adds or removes more instances of a server to a pool. |
| **Example** | Upgrading a server to a larger instance type. | Adding more web servers behind a load balancer. |
| **Downtime** | Often requires downtime to implement. | No downtime is required, as new instances are added to the pool. |
| **Complexity** | Simpler to manage. | More complex, as it requires a distributed architecture and managing multiple instances. |
| **Flexibility** | Less flexible, as there are physical and technical limits on how much a single machine can be upgraded. | Highly flexible and can scale almost infinitely by adding more machines. |
| **Cost** | Can have lower up-front costs, but becomes expensive at higher capacities. | May have higher up-front costs but is often more cost-effective in the long term. |
| **Best for** | Applications with consistent performance needs or those that are difficult to distribute, like some databases. | Applications with fluctuating traffic or high demand, like web servers or APIs. |
