Technique that help to minimize data re-arrangment from one node server to another.

### Problem
When a new server node is added or removed then data is not available in new hashed function resultant key server, let's understand now!

Currently I have 500M active users handled by 5 server, now i want to scale up my application. I'll add more 2 server nodes to handle around 700M users.

Now hashed function result will also get's changed (MOD HASHING), data might not be saved wrt new server hashed function.

To solve this `Consistant Hashing` introduced.
