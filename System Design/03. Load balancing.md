### We can add LB in all 3 places
1. Between User and web-server(client).
2. Between web-server and application server(server).
3. Between app server and database.

## LB Strategies
1. `Round Robin` Most usefull when the servers have equal specifications. Cycle through a list of servers and distribute the network request.
